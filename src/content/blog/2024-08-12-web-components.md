#### What are Web Components?
Web Components are a set of standards for building reusable and encapsulated components for the web. They allow you to create custom HTML elements that can be used just like built-in ones (eg: `<div>` or `<span>`).

Web Components are comprised of three main technologies:
- **Custom Elements** which lets you define new HTML tags and specify their behavior.
- **Shadow DOM** which provides encapsulation, meaning styles and scripts inside the component don't affect the rest of the page.
- **HTML Templates** define the component's markup, which is rendered when the component is used.

#### Web Components Vs Frameworks

Web Components are more about creating native, reusable elements that work across frameworks and libraries. Frameworks, like React, Vue & Angular, use a virtual DOM and have a specific way of managing state, reactivity, and lifecycle methods. Web components are still advantageous over frameworks like Svelte or Solid, as they are more broadly compatible with different tools and frameworks.

Web Components only need a script file, for the logic & definitions, to be included in the HTML using the custom tag.  Another way of thinking about it is Web Components can be used in any Framework to compose components but not the reverse.

#### Why do we need Web Components?

- *Reusability*: They allow you to create components that can be used in any web application, regardless of the framework or library employed.
- *Encapsulation*: The Shadow DOM allows you to ensure that the internal structure and styling of your components don't interfere with the rest of your page, and vice versa.
- *Interoperability*: They work natively in the browser and can be used across different frameworks or libraries, making them a good choice for building components that may be shared between multiple projects.

#### Downsides to using Web Components

- *Browser Support*: Although most modern browsers support Web Components, older browsers might not, requiring polyfills that can add to the complexity.
- *Performance*: The Shadow DOM and custom elements can have performance implications, especially if not used carefully.
- *Complexity*: Some developers might find Web Components more complex when compared to using a framework like React or Vue that provides additional tools and abstractions.
- *Ecosystem*: Web Components don't have a rich ecosystem or as many libraries and tools when compared to more established frameworks, which can sometimes limit functionality and support.

#### When NOT to use Web Components?

- **Heavy Framework Dependency**: If you're already deeply invested in a framework, like Angular or React, using Web Components might not offer significant benefits and could add unnecessary complexity.
- **Performance Constraints**: For applications with very high-performance requirements, the overhead of Web Components' encapsulation and shadow DOM might be a concern.
- **Legacy Browser Support**: If you need to support older browsers that don't fully support Web Components, you might face challenges or need to implement polyfills, which could complicate your project.

#### Conclusion

Web Components are a powerful tool for creating reusable and encapsulated components that work across different frameworks. However, they come with trade-offs and may not always be the best choice depending on your project's requirements and existing technology stack.
